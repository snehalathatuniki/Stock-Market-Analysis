This project is centered on the exploration and analysis of stock market data, focusing specifically on a selection of prominent technology companiesâ€”namely Dominos, Amazon, Netflix, and Bitcoin. Utilizing Python as the primary analytical tool, the project will delve into retrieving, processing, and visualizing stock performance data to uncover insights and assess risk. Moreover, it will employ advanced statistical techniques to predict future stock prices, with a spotlight on the application of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited to time series forecasting.
